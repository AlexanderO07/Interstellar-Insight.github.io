# NASA-Calendar

If you want to keep up with NASA's achievements this website can help. With Nasa expanding its space exploration efforts and the invention of the James Webber telescope, keeping up to date with NASA's activities is crucial. This website project uses the date inputed by the user in the calendar, fetches NASA's public open API databases and parses through its image, video, and audio parameters with the specific date.

To start, simply type a date in month,day,year (MM/DD/YYYY) format or select a day and year from the dropdown function. When you have selected a valid date, press the submit button. 

Web Service Rate Limit Note: Limits are placed on the number of API requests you may make using my API key. Please remember that the hourly limit is 1,000 requests per hour. Exceeding these limits will lead to the API key being temporarily blocked from making further requests. The block will automatically be lifted by waiting an hour from the last valid request.
