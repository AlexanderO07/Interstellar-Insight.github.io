# NASA-Calendar

If you want to keep up with NASA's achievements the Interstellar Insight website can help. With Nasa expanding its space exploration efforts and the invention of the James Webber telescope, keeping up to date with NASA's activities is crucial. This website project allows users to keep up to date with NASA's activities. It fetches NASA's public open API databases and displays image, video, and audio content related to the user-selected date. Users can input a date in MM/DD/YYYY format or select it from a dropdown function and submit the request by clicking the submit button.

Web Service Rate Limit Note: Limits are placed on the number of API requests you may make using my API key. Please remember that the hourly limit is 1,000 requests per hour. Exceeding these limits will lead to the API key being temporarily blocked from making further requests. The block will automatically be lifted by waiting an hour from the last valid request.
